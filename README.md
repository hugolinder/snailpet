Software for head Nodding Adjustment in Interfile Listmode data for Positron Emission Tomography

This branch is a toy version of the larger project, where I want to familiarize myself with organizing the project, before commiting a lot of code to this new structure. 

I want to:
  have a base, which I can use as a simple example of a project, as reference.
  practice pytest, import, style check, subpackages, and setup. 
  go through development to actual package. Furthermore I want to practice using git. 

example: 
  $ python -c "import project_tutorial; project_tutorial.test()"
  run example in a notebook demonstrating the package. 

References:
  I will look to the packages odl, odlpet, stir for guidance.
